# Sentiment_Analysis
The project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using the Tweepy library. Sentiment analysis is an NLP technique that determines the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, in this case, tweets from Twitter. The project collects tweets related to specific topics or events using Tweepy, processes the text data, and then applies a sentiment analysis model to classify the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed.
